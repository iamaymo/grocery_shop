<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This Flutter-based mobile application is designed to simulate a grocery delivery system. The app provides an intuitive user interface where users can add fresh items to their cart and proceed through a mock payment process.

### Features

- <B>Introduction Page:</B> The first screen welcomes users with a simple yet appealing design, offering a “Get Started” button to begin shopping.
- <B>Browse and Select Items:</B> The main shopping screen presents a list of grocery items (e.g., Avocado, Banana, Chicken, Water, Ice Cream). Each item shows a price, and users can tap the price to add the item directly to their cart.
- <B>Cart Management:</B>
  - Users can view the selected items in the cart, which is accessible by clicking the cart icon.
  - Each item in the cart has a remove option (marked by an "X") to allow users to take out items they no longer want.
  - The total price is dynamically updated as items are added or removed.
- <B>Payment Process:</B>
  - The app includes a mock payment flow, where users are prompted to enter their name and a card number (no real transaction occurs).
  - A "Pay Now" button finalizes the order, allowing users to experience the entire purchasing process in a simplified form.
